## OFFENTLIGA RUMMER BLOCKCHAIN HACKATHON 2018 ENTRY

### IDEA:
"Most of us have come across some kind of exhausting queues that have no end in sight, isn't it frustrating not knowing anything? Take for example the situation when you are searching for a place to live. You then proceed to find an accommodation or stand in an opaque queue for a long time.  You don’t see any progress and you are starting to lose trust in the system.  What happens behind the scenes? Is there some hidden algorithm that favours a special group of people? Is it possible that the system is rigged against you?
You as a user have the right to know how and when your application is handled, especially if it is in the public sector. 
Our approach is to use blockchain technology to manage queues and case applications in the public sector. The approach is called OrderlyQ and it’s a system module that will provide queue management to services in the public sector. In other words, it is to be integrated with the backend of other systems and not have a visible user interface.  The advantages of blockchain technology are increased transparency, security and traceability. OrderlyQ will provide transparency for the end user by making the queue management processes entirely visible.  The user will be able to access information about how its queue placement is faring against the masses. Regarding the security aspect it will be close to impossible to tamper with the queue placements. Why this is possible is due to blockchains immutable block property.  Last but not least OrderlyQ will provide an easy way for the user to track its position in the queue and see how the status is changing overtime. 

The final result of implementing Orderly Q in the public sector will be increased transparency, security and traceability for the handling and ordering of public cases/records. Possibly areas of use are in medical queues, the queues for cases at the immigration office and housing marketing queues, the list goes on…"


### CODE
The code within this repository is in its current state a demonstration of how the process would work on the backend. It is currently using a database to store blocks, which is of course not how it should work if the project was to be realized.
